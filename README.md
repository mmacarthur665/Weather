# Weather

This program is intended to take user input of a zipcode and pull weather forecast information from the web. It leverages Selenium, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and many other packages. 

Make sure you have a Selenium webdriver (chrome is my preference) on your machine somewhere before trying to run the code.
